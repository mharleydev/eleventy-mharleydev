Hey everyone! 👋🏻

My name is Michael and I'm building this website with my bare hands. My day job is working as a SharePoint Developer/Engineer/Wizard at [Bridgestone Americas](https://www.bridgestoneamericas.com). I use PowerShell, SharePoint (2013/2016/Online), Office 365, Power Automate and Power Apps to solve problems.

I'm an aspiring web developer so I'm teaching myself the skills. 😎
