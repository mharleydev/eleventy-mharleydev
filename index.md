Hey everyone! 👋🏻

My name is Michael and I'm teaching myself web development by building this website with my bare hands. 

I'm available for my next job opportunity after December 7th. I'm looking for opportunities as a SharePoint Developer/Engineer. I use PowerShell, SharePoint (2013/2016/Online), Office 365, Power Automate and Power Apps to solve problems. You can see my resume [here](/resume/).
